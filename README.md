Overview
This program was designed to provide a fast and reliable way to estimate the physical requirements of a hot rolling pass.
Instead of waiting for complex Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, you can get a "worst-case scenario" engineering estimate in seconds.

Key Features

-High Accuracy: Validated against industrial data (within 1.5% margin of error for rolling force!).
-Ekelund-Model based: Uses the industry-standard Ekelund equation for flow stress ($k_f$) and force calculation.
-Material Library: Includes presets for common steels like S235 and 37MnSi5.
-Safety Monitoring: Automatically checks for motor overload and provides a [SAFE] or [DANGER] status based on your equipment's capacity.


How it works

The calculator takes the entry and exit dimensions, the temperature, and the roll diameter to determine the deformation resistance. It then calculates:
Rolling Force (kN)
Torque on the rolls (kNm)
Required Power (kW)

Note to user:

The torque calculated is the physical requirement at the rolls.
When comparing to rated motor torque, remember to account for your gearbox ratio (i) and efficiency!

Feel free to use it whenever and however you may like it. 
Re-design it in a way it appeals to you and have fun calculating these datas.
